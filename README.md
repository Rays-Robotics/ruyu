**Note**: We do not support or condone piracy in any form. To use ruyu, you'll need keys from your real Switch system and games that you have legally obtained and paid for. We do not intend to profit from this project.

We're looking for developers! If you're interested in contributing, please join our chat or reach out to a developer.

This repository is a fork of suyu, which itself is a fork of yuzu, as suyu is shutting down. We are in the process of developing ruyu, and our website and downloads will be available soon.

<h4 align="center"><b>ruyu</b> is the next evolution of the world's most popular open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, yuzu, now continuing as a fork of suyu.

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, and we aim to provide builds for Windows, Linux, and Android, with iOS support planned for the future.
